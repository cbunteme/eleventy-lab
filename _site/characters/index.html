        <h1>Main Characters</h1>
<p>There are 3 main characters in Attack on Titan, amongst many others. Below you will see a biography for each main character as well as a photo so you can put a face to the name!</p>
<h2>Eren Yeager</h2>

<p>Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー) is a former member of the Survey Corps. He is the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents and adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan. This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.</p>
<h2>Mikasa Ackerman</h2>
<img class="bio" src="..//img/mikasa.png" alt="Mikasa" width="400" height="400">
<p>Mikasa Ackerman (ミカサ・アッカーマン) is the adoptive sister of Eren Yeager and one of the two deuteragonists of the series, along with Armin Arlert.</p>
<p>After her biological parents were murdered by human traffickers, Mikasa was rescued by Eren Yeager and lived with him and his parents, Grisha and Carla, before the fall of Wall Maria.</p>
<h2>Armin Arlert</h2>
<img class="bio" src="..//img/armin.png" alt="Armin" width="400" height="400">
<p>Armin Arlert (アルミン・アルレルト) is the 15th and current commander of the Survey Corps, named so by Hange Zoë. He is also a childhood friend of Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman, and one of the two deuteragonists of the series. Although he appears to be among the physically weakest of the 104th Training Corps, his intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset, especially when paired with Hange.</p>
